          <div class="scrollbar" id="style-1">The Kanheri Caves, Mumbai, have stood strong through the turns of two
            millennia. The caves were created on an outcrop of basalt on the island of Salsette, also known as
            Shatshashthi in Mumbai. Located six miles from Thane, these caves were constructed during the 1st century CE
            and 10th century CE. <br><br>
            The caves are believed to have been crafted by Buddhist monks. There are widespread markers of Buddhism and
            the teachings of the religion in the architecture and carvings of the caves. Having been constructed on a
            hill with basalt rocks, the Kanheri Caves, Mumbai, derive the origin of their name from the Sanskrit word
            Krishnagiri which means black mountain.<br><br>
            During the 3rd century BCE, the Kanheri Caves became a major epicentre of the Buddhist settlement in the
            region. Serving as Buddhist viharas, the caves were a place of worship, studies, and meditation.
            Furthermore, during the reign of the Kushana and Maurya dynasties, the Kanheri Caves, and Mumbai, were also
            a functional universities. <br><br>

        <h2>The Distinct Architecture of the <br>Kanheri Caves, Mumbai </h2>
        <div class="cavesIMG-holder">


          <div class="scrollbar" id="style-1">One of the things that make the Kanheri Caves a striking architectural
            marvel and distinguish them from other similar relics across the nation is the fact that they have been
            carved out of a single piece of rock. Carved out of basalt rocks, the Kanheri Gufa is adorned with
            inscriptions celebrating Buddhism.<br><br>
            Since the 109 caves have been constructed across a period spanning a thousand years, the caves are vastly
            different in shape, size, and level of sophistication. The architecture of the earliest caves has been
            influenced by the Hinayana sect of Buddhism, whilst the subsequent caves display markers of the Mahayana
            sect of Buddhism. <br><br>
            Featuring sculptures, rock carvings, and paintings dedicated to Buddhist lore and religious teachings, the
            Kanheri Gufa is also home to an intricate and impressive network of water cisterns. Cave 3 is amongst the
            centrepieces of the Kanheri Caves, with a beautiful chaitya-griha, a stupa, and a courtyard coupled with a
            statue of the Buddha to mark the entrance to the cave. Most of the inscriptions in the Kanheri Gufas are in
            Brahmi and Devanagari scripts.
